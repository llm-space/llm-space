## Introduction

A workbench for prompt and agent development — build, trace, debug, evaluate, and manage, all in one place. It ships as a native **desktop app** (Electrobun), not a website.

## Tooling

**mise is the task front door** — `mise tasks ls` lists every entry point; task bodies forward to package.json scripts, the implementation layer. **bun** is the package manager and JS runtime (fuzzy-pinned in `mise.toml`, exact version + checksums locked in `mise.lock` — regenerate with `mise lock` when bumping). Do not use npm/pnpm/yarn.

| Task                                   | Command                                                                     | Notes                                                                                                                  |
| -------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Set up a fresh clone                   | `mise run setup`                                                            | installs the locked toolchain (`mise install`) + JS deps (`bun install`)                                               |
| Install deps                           | `bun install`                                                               | from repo root                                                                                                         |
| Run desktop app                        | `mise run dev`                                                              | → `cd apps/desktop && bun run dev:hmr` (Vite HMR on :5173 + `vite build && electrobun dev`; restart to pick up bun main-process changes) |
| Run desktop app with CEF/CDP debugging | `mise run dev:cef`                                                          | → `cd apps/desktop && bun run dev:cef`; exposes CDP on `127.0.0.1:9333` by default                                     |
| Run the web site (landing + viewer)    | `mise run dev:web`                                                          | → `bun --filter @llm-space/web dev` (Vite on :5175). Landing at `/llm-space/`, viewer at `/llm-space/#/thread/<user>/<gist-id>` |
| Build (canary)                         | `mise run build:canary`                                                     | → `vite build && electrobun build --env=canary` in `apps/desktop`                                                      |
| Build (stable)                         | `mise run build:stable`                                                     | → `vite build && electrobun build --env=stable` in `apps/desktop`                                                      |
| Build the web site                     | `mise run build:web`                                                        | → `bun --filter @llm-space/web build` (static, `base=/llm-space/`, out to `web/dist`). CI + the Pages workflow run this |
| Local packaging / update test          | `mise run pack` · `pack:perf` · `pack:adhoc` · `pack:signed` · `pack:feed` + `feed:serve` | env combinations over `build:canary` (skip signing / CEF Performance edition / ad-hoc sign / local update feed on :8321); defined in `mise.toml` |
| Cut a release                          | `mise run release` / `mise run release:canary`                              | → `bun scripts/release.ts`; see "Releases & auto-update"                                                               |
| Test                                   | `mise run test`                                                             | runs the complete Bun test suite from the repository root                                                                  |
| Lint                                   | `mise run lint` / `mise run lint:fix`                                       | `lint` = `eslint .` (read-only), `lint:fix` = `eslint --fix .`; flat config at repo root                               |
| Typecheck                              | `mise run typecheck`                                                        | `tsc --noEmit` over four projects: root, `packages/ui`, `apps/desktop`, `web`. `packages/ui`/`web` are React/DOM code, so they need their own DOM tsconfigs (the root config is Bun-flavored and excludes `packages/ui`); add a project here when you add a workspace. |
| Add a dependency                       | `bun add <pkg>`                                                             | run inside the target package (`apps/desktop` or `packages/core`)                                                      |
| Add a shadcn/ui component              | `bunx --bun shadcn@latest add <component>`                                  | run inside `packages/ui` (the shared design system now lives there, not `apps/desktop`)                                |
| Run a script from root                 | `bun --filter <pkg> <script>`                                               | e.g. `bun --filter @llm-space/desktop start`                                                                           |

Bun's built-in test runner discovers the repository's `*.test.ts` files through `mise run test`. CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs tests + lint + typecheck + a production `vite build` + workflow-YAML validation on PRs and pushes to main. The last two exist because both failure modes are invisible until a release tag is pushed, and then take the release down with them: a renderer bundle that outgrows the runner's V8 heap (`build:view` sets `--max-old-space-size=4096`; the default ~2 GB stopped being enough at 14701 modules) and a malformed workflow file. Keep the renderer bundle in mind — if `vite build` starts OOMing again, raise the ceiling in `build:view` or cut the bundle down, and don't discover it at release time.

GUI commits (VS Code, Fork) failing with `bun: command not found`: husky hooks need bun on PATH — add `export PATH="$HOME/.local/share/mise/shims:$PATH"` to `~/.config/husky/init.sh` (husky's documented fix for version managers).

Shared dependency versions live in the root `package.json` `catalog` (referenced as `"catalog:"`) — bump them there, not per-package. The catalog currently pins `@earendil-works/pi-ai`, `@earendil-works/pi-agent-core`, `react`, `react-dom`, and `typebox`.

### Electrobun page debugging

When you need to inspect or debug the real desktop renderer, use the project
skill at `./.agents/skills/electrobun-cdp-debug/SKILL.md`. Do **not** mock
`electrobun.rpc` in a browser.

Start with `mise run dev:cef`; normal `mise run dev` keeps the native WebView
renderer and does not expose CDP.

When CEF/CDP verification needs an isolated app data root, put runtime sandbox
data in the system temporary directory by default, not under `.agents/` or the
repo:

```sh
TMP_ROOT="$(mktemp -d "${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/llm-space-XXXXXX")"
LLM_SPACE_HOME="$TMP_ROOT" mise run dev:cef
```

Only keep durable evidence in the repo, such as audit screenshots, notes, logs,
and small redacted JSON snippets. Do not commit or leave routine `workspace/`,
`settings/`, caches, or generated app data under `.agents/kaizen-loop/` unless a
fixture is intentionally preserved for review and the reason is documented.

## Architecture

Bun-workspace monorepo. Workspaces are `packages/*`, `apps/*`, and `web`.

- **`@llm-space/core`** (`packages/core`) — domain library, **no build step**; its TypeScript is consumed directly via the `exports` map. Entrypoints:
  - `.` → re-exports the internal `client`, `parsers`, `types`, and `utils` directories (all browser-safe).
  - `./client` — browser-safe pieces: the `streamThread()` client (`client/api`), the `reduceMessages()` streaming reducer (`client/reducer`), and the `AgentTransport` interface (`client/transport`).
  - `./thread` — headless thread semantics shared by both runtime contexts: run history (`thread/history`), prompt variables (`thread/prompt-variables`), and usage aggregation (`thread/usage`).
  - `./server` — Node/Bun-only implementations: `streamAgent()` (`server/agent/stream`), filesystem paths (`server/paths` — `getLlmSpaceHomePath()`, `getSettingsDir()`), `LocalFileSystem` thread storage (`server/storage`), and window-state persistence (`server/window-state`).
  - `./types` — `Thread`/`Message`/`ModelConfig`/`Tool`/`FileNode`/`ModelProviderGroup` and the converters to/from the `@earendil-works/pi-*` formats.
- **`@llm-space/ui`** (`packages/ui`) — the shared React design system + **Thread Playground**, **no build step** (consumed as TS via the `exports` map), and **Electrobun-free** so both the desktop renderer and the static web app render the same UI. Holds: shadcn primitives (`./ui/*`), `cn` + pure helpers (`./lib/*`), design tokens (`./styles/globals.css`, Tailwind v4), app-level components (`./components/*` — thread-playground, model-provider, code-editor, tooltip, confirm-dialog, markdown, preview-dialog, …), and the **`HostServices` seam** (`./host`). Internal files use **relative imports** (never `@/`, which the desktop bundler would hijack); `exports` uses a `.tsx` wildcard for `./components/*` plus explicit entries for the `thread-playground` barrel, `examples/prompts` (a `.ts` subpath), and `code-editor` (both tsc and Vite must resolve them). shadcn `ui/` is ESLint-ignored (`packages/ui/src/ui/**`); add components with a `packages/ui/components.json`.
  - **The `HostServices` seam** (`packages/ui/src/host/`) is how the playground stays decoupled: everything host-specific — `transport`, `executeTool`, `skills`/`mcp`/`builtinTools`/`paths` clients, `actions` (navigation, replacing the desktop command bus), and a `presentational` flag — is injected via `HostServicesProvider` + `useHostServices()`. Model access is a separate injected `ModelClient` fed to `ModelProvider`. **Desktop** supplies the real, Electrobun-backed impls in `apps/desktop/src/host/host-services.tsx` (`DesktopHostProvider` + `createElectrobunModelClient`); **web** supplies display-only no-op stubs. Never import `@/client`/`@/commands`/`electrobun` from inside `packages/ui`.
- **`@llm-space/desktop`** (`apps/desktop`) — the Electrobun app. Built with Vite (React 19) for the renderer and `electrobun` for the shell. Two runtime contexts bridged by a single typed RPC channel:
  - **bun main process** (`src/bun/`) — owns the native window, menu, filesystem, model config, and agent streaming.
  - **webview renderer** (`src/app`, `src/components`, `src/mainview`) — the React UI. The Thread Playground and design system now live in `@llm-space/ui`; the renderer imports them and provides the desktop `HostServices`/`ModelClient`.
- **`@llm-space/web`** (`web/`) — the **static site**: the marketing **landing page** at `/llm-space/` and a **display-only shared-thread viewer** at `/llm-space/#/thread/<user>/<gist-id>` (fetches a gist's JSON, renders `@llm-space/ui`'s `ThreadPlayground` with a stub `HostServices`, `presentational: true`). No Electrobun, no backend. `base: "/llm-space/"`; CodeMirror is **not** deduped in `web/vite.config.ts` (no direct dep — one copy already resolves through the package). The landing page is **vendored** under `web/src/landing/` (self-contained, its own single-quote style — ESLint-ignored, still typechecked); its extra CSS is additive in `web/src/landing/index.css` (the shadcn tokens live in `@llm-space/ui/styles/globals.css`; the near-black bg is scoped to the landing root). **Deploy:** `.github/workflows/pages.yml` builds `web/` on push to `main` and publishes via `actions/deploy-pages` (repo Pages Source is **GitHub Actions**). CI (`ci.yml`) also builds `web/` so PRs catch breakage.

### The RPC bridge

The typed contract lives in `src/shared/rpc.ts` (`DesktopRPCType`). The bun side creates handlers in `src/bun/rpc/index.ts` (`createMainWindowRPC()`); the renderer holds the client in `src/lib/electrobun.ts` (`electrobun.rpc`). Two directions:

- **requests** (webview → bun, request/response): `availableModels`, `addProvider`/`updateProvider`/`removeProvider`/`setModelEnabled`/…, and the filesystem ops `fsLs`/`fsRead`/`fsWrite`/`fsMkdir`/`fsCp`/`fsMv`/`fsRm`/`fsReveal` (mirroring what were HTTP routes).
- **messages** (fire-and-forget, both ways): agent streaming (`sendStreamThreadRequest` / `receiveStreamThreadResponse` / `abortStreamThread`), fullscreen sync, update status (`updateStatusChanged`), and `executeCommand` (see the command layer).

Electrobun RPC has no native streaming, so agent runs **simulate a stream over fire-and-forget messages**, correlated by a per-run `streamId` (uuid):

1. Renderer `createRpcTransport()` (`src/client/rpc-transport.ts`) sends `sendStreamThreadRequest { streamId, request }`.
2. Bun `StreamThreadController.run()` (`bun/streaming/stream-thread.ts`) iterates `streamAgent()` and sends back `receiveStreamThreadResponse` messages keyed by `streamId`: one `{ type: "event" }` per event, then a terminal `{ type: "done" }` or `{ type: "error", message }`.
3. The transport keeps a per-`streamId` listener that buffers events and drives an async iterator via a wake/notify promise — turning the message stream back into `for await`. `done` ends it, `error` throws, and abort (signal or early break) sends `abortStreamThread`, which calls `StreamThreadController.abort()` for the bun-side `AbortController`.

Downstream, `reduceMessages()` folds the events into messages.

### Bun composition and bundled modules

The Bun process object graph is assembled in one production composition root,
`src/bun/app/start-desktop-app.ts`. Process-scoped managers are constructed
there and passed explicitly to RPC, streaming, commands, updates, and tool
factories; Bun feature modules must not export import-time manager instances or
reach through a service locator.

`DesktopHost` (`src/bun/host/desktop-host.ts`) is the lifecycle boundary for
trusted, bundled modules. Modules register synchronously before RPC/window
creation, the contribution registry then freezes for the process lifetime, and
cleanup runs in reverse order on a best-effort basis. Startup errors include
the module id. Electrobun quit uses a two-phase handshake so asynchronous host,
MCP, and analytics cleanup finishes before the process exits.

V1 exposes one internal extension seam: `ToolContribution` through
`ToolRegistry` (`src/bun/tools/tool-registry.ts`). Contributions have stable
unique ids and tool names; registration snapshots and freezes tool definitions.
The bundled built-in-tools module is the reference implementation. This is not
a public plugin SDK: dynamic loading, manifests, permissions, runtime
enable/disable, renderer contributions, and third-party compatibility remain
out of scope.

### Data flow (the core loop)

UI action → Zustand `run()` (`components/thread-playground/stores/thread-store.ts`) → `streamThread()` (core) with an injected `AgentTransport`. The desktop transport is `createRpcTransport()`, wired in once at `components/thread-tabs/thread-tab-pane.tsx`; it runs the RPC streaming dance above. On the bun side `StreamThreadController.run()` calls `streamAgent()` (`@llm-space/core/server`), which drives `agentLoopContinue()` from `@earendil-works/pi-agent-core`. The resulting event iterator → `reduceMessages()` → Zustand → UI re-renders.

### Thread store

Each open thread owns its own Zustand store (`stores/thread-store.ts`), created per-tab via `createThreadStore()` and supplied through `ThreadStoreContext` — there is **no global store**. Read it with `useThreadStore(selector)` and `useThreadStoreActions()`. State holds the `thread`, `streamingMessage`, `status`, `runHistory`, and `changeHistory`; `run()` drives a streaming turn. Undo/redo lives in `stores/thread-history.ts`: snapshots are thread _references_ (copy-on-write shares unchanged substructure, so undo is an O(1) pointer move), capped by count and a retained-image-bytes budget.

### Persistence

State is **persisted to disk** under the llm-space root (`~/.llm-space` by default; override with `LLM_SPACE_HOME`):

- `workspace/` — thread files as JSON, served through `LocalFileSystem` behind the `fs*` RPC requests. On a fresh install `bun/workspace/seed.ts` creates the empty directory so the welcome screen can offer blank-thread and example-start choices.
- `settings/` — `models.json` (configured providers, owned by `ModelManager`) and `window.json` (frame/zoom/maximized).

### Releases & auto-update

The app version has a **single source of truth: `apps/desktop/package.json`** — `electrobun.config.ts` imports it, and release CI fails if the pushed tag doesn't match. Cut releases with `mise run release` (stable) or `mise run release:canary`; the script (`scripts/release.ts`) runs `commit-and-tag-version` (conventional-commits-driven version bump + commit + `v*` tag, config in `.versionrc.json`) and pushes atomically. Automated changelog generation is off (`skip.changelog`) — the `CHANGELOG.md` at the repo root is **hand-curated** (Keep a Changelog format), so before cutting a stable release, add a `## [x.y.z]` section for it. CI builds each versioned release's GitHub notes by extracting that version's `CHANGELOG.md` section (no `--generate-notes`, which would dump commits/authors) and appending the install blurb; prereleases with no changelog entry (canary) fall back to install-only notes. The tag triggers `.github/workflows/release.yml`: build → codesign/notarize (canary/stable only; needs the `MACOS_*`/`ASC_*` signing secrets, mapped to electrobun's `ELECTROBUN_*` env vars in the workflow) → smoke test → upload. Artifacts land in two GitHub releases: the rolling `updates` release is the machine-readable update feed (`release.baseUrl` points at it; **never delete its `.patch` files** — old installs chain through them), and a versioned release carries the DMG for humans. In-app auto-update lives in `bun/updates/` (background check → silent download → "restart to update" toast via the `updateStatusChanged` message); the dev channel never updates.

**Two editions ship from every tag.** The regular one drives the system WebView; the **Performance** edition embeds Chromium (CEF). `LLM_SPACE_DESKTOP_RENDERER=cef` is the only switch — `electrobun.config.ts` forks the app name (`LLM Space Performance`), the identifier (`…llm-space.performance`) and the update feed off it, so the two install side by side in `/Applications` and update independently. They deliberately **share `~/.llm-space`** (`getLlmSpaceHomePath()` is name-independent), so switching editions keeps threads and settings. Two things make this work and will silently break if touched: (1) each edition needs its **own rolling update release** (`updates` / `updates-performance`) — `update.json` is named `{channel}-{os}-{arch}-update.json` with no app name, so a shared release would have them overwrite each other; hence the release workflow downloads the two editions' artifacts into **separate directories** rather than `merge-multiple` into one. (2) CEF must **not** get a `remote-debugging-port` in shipped builds — `chromiumFlags` is only set when `LLM_SPACE_DESKTOP_CDP_PORT` is explicitly passed (which `dev:cef` does, and CI never does); an always-on CDP port would let any local process drive the renderer. Build the Performance edition locally with `mise run pack:perf`.

Releases ship for **macOS arm64 + x64** (so four build jobs per tag: 2 arches × 2 editions). Intel builds need `apps/desktop/scripts/fix-x64-headerpad.ts` (wired as the `postBuild`/`postWrap` hooks): electrobun's darwin-x64 core binaries have no Mach-O headerpad, so signing them corrupts `__text` and the app segfaults on launch (electrobun#485). The hook frees 16 bytes of load-command room before signing and no-ops everywhere else; delete it when upstream fixes #485. It deliberately scans only the top level of `Contents/MacOS/`, which does **not** cover the binaries CEF adds (the `Chromium Embedded Framework.framework` and the five `Contents/Frameworks/bun Helper*.app` helpers, whose executable is electrobun's `process_helper`). That is correct, and was verified against the real darwin-x64 core rather than assumed: the CEF framework ships pre-signed (adhoc, linker-signed), and x64 `process_helper` — although unsigned like `extractor`/`launcher` — already has headerpad ≥ 16, so `codesign` can append `LC_CODE_SIGNATURE` without corrupting it. Running the hook against the x64 core reports `process_helper — ok` while `extractor`/`launcher` come back `fixed`. Don't widen the hook's scan on a hunch; re-run that check instead.

### The command layer

Every cross-boundary user action (menus, context menus, toolbar buttons, shortcuts) is a `Command` — a `type` discriminant + typed `args` — defined in `src/shared/commands.ts`. `COMMAND_META` tags each with a `target` of `"webview"` or `"bun"`. A single `executeCommand` on each side routes it: the bun side (`bun/commands.ts` `executeCommandInBun`) runs `bun`-target commands locally (window zoom/reload, open external links) and forwards `webview`-target ones over RPC; the renderer (`commands/index.tsx` `CommandProvider`) does the reverse. The native menu (`bun/app/menu.ts`) maps its string actions into commands.

### App layout (`apps/desktop/src`)

- `mainview/` — the Vite entry: `index.html` + `main.tsx` mounting `<App>`.
- `app/` — `index.tsx` (App), `layout.tsx` (providers: React Query, `ModelProvider`, tooltips, sonner toaster), `page.tsx` (resizable sidebar + tabs, settings/command-palette/onboard dialogs).
- `bun/` — main-process code: `app/` (window, menu, window-state), `rpc/`, `streaming/`, `storage/`, `models/` (`ModelManager` + builtin/custom providers), `auth/` (`GitHubAuthManager` — OAuth Device Flow + `settings/auth.json`), `fs/` (trash/reveal), `env/hydrate` (loads login-shell env — API keys/PATH — before anything reads `process.env`), `workspace/seed`.

> **GitHub calls go through the proxy.** GitHub auth (`bun/auth/`) and any future gist calls run from the **bun process** using the global `fetch`, which `NetworkSettingsManager` (`bun/network/`) routes through the user's configured proxy by writing `HTTP(S)_PROXY` onto `process.env`. Just call `fetch` — never add a bypassing custom dispatcher, or corporate/proxied users' GitHub requests will fail.
- `client/` — renderer-side RPC callers: `rpc-transport.ts` (streaming) and `local-file-system.ts` (the `fs*` requests).
- `host/` — `host-services.tsx`: the desktop `HostServices` + `ModelClient` impls (`DesktopHostProvider`, `createElectrobunModelClient`) feeding the shared `@llm-space/ui` playground.
- `shared/` — code used by both contexts: `rpc.ts`, `commands.ts`.
- `components/` — desktop-only UI: `thread-tabs/`, `file-system-tree-view/`, `settings/`, `command-palette.tsx`, `onboard-dialog.tsx`, and the account/update/github widgets. **The Thread Playground, model-provider, code-editor, shadcn `ui/`, and design tokens moved to `@llm-space/ui`** — import them from there, not from `@/components`.
- Design tokens live in `@llm-space/ui/styles/globals.css` (Tailwind v4 + OKLch), imported once by `app/layout.tsx`. The app is dark-themed.

### Web site (GitHub Pages) — how it publishes

The site at **`deer-flow.github.io/llm-space/`** (landing page + shared-thread viewer) is the `@llm-space/web` app (`web/`). Publishing is **fully automated via GitHub Actions** — there is no manual deploy step:

- **`.github/workflows/pages.yml`** runs on every push to `main` (and `workflow_dispatch`): `bun --filter @llm-space/web build` → `actions/upload-pages-artifact` (`web/dist`) → `actions/deploy-pages`. So **merging to `main` publishes the site** — nothing else to do.
- **One-time repo setting (already done once):** Settings → Pages → **Source = "GitHub Actions"**. If Pages ever reverts to "Deploy from a branch", the workflow's `deploy-pages` step fails until it's set back.
- `web/` uses `base: "/llm-space/"`; absolute asset refs in JSX must go through `import.meta.env.BASE_URL`. No `.nojekyll` is needed (the Actions artifact bypasses Jekyll).
- CI (`ci.yml`) also runs `build:web` on PRs, so a Vite break is caught before it reaches Pages.

### Static assets (images, etc.)

There are two kinds of assets, and they land in different places:

- **Imported assets** — `import logo from "./logo.svg"`. Vite hashes these into `dist/assets`, which `electrobun.config.ts` already copies to `views/mainview/assets`. No config change needed.
- **Public assets referenced by absolute path** — e.g. `<img src="/images/onboard.png">`. These live under **`src/mainview/public/`** (Vite's `root` is `src/mainview`, so `public/images/onboard.png` is served at `/images/onboard.png`). Vite copies `public/` verbatim into `dist/`, but a **packaged build only copies what `electrobun.config.ts` `build.copy` lists** — so any new top-level public folder must be added there, or it 404s in the built app. Today `build.copy` maps `dist/images` → `views/mainview/images`; if you add, say, `public/fonts/`, add a `"dist/fonts": "views/mainview/fonts"` entry too.

Prefer dropping new images into the existing `src/mainview/public/images/` folder so no config edit is required.

## Conventions

- **TypeScript**: strict, ESNext, `moduleResolution: bundler`. In `apps/desktop`, `@/*` maps to `./src/*`.
- **Layering**: `@llm-space/core` splits browser-safe code (`./client`, `./thread`, `./types`, root `.`) from Node/Bun-only server implementations (`./server`). The desktop **bun process** consumes `@llm-space/core/server`; the **renderer** consumes the client/types entrypoints and reaches the bun process over RPC (never imports `./server`).

### Naming

- **File names** are **kebab-case** for every `.ts`/`.tsx` file, including component files (e.g. `tool-call-list-item.tsx`, `model-provider.tsx`). No PascalCase or camelCase filenames. One primary component/export per file, named after the file.
- **Identifiers**:
  - React components, classes, types, and interfaces are **PascalCase** (`ThreadPlayground`, `ModelManager`, `Command`, `FileNode`).
  - Functions, variables, hooks, and command `type` discriminants are **camelCase** (`createMainWindowRPC`, `useThreadTabs`, `newFile`, `closeTab`).
  - Module-level constants are **UPPER_SNAKE_CASE** (`DOCS_URL`, `ZOOM_STEP`, `COMMAND_META`, `BUILTIN_PROVIDERS`).
- **Leading underscore for what's private**:
  - Module-private (non-exported) functions: `_foo()`.
  - Private class members: `_config`, `_models`, `_loadConfig()` (see `ModelManager`).
  - When a wrapper re-exports a primitive under the same name, alias the primitive with a leading underscore to avoid the collision (`import { Tooltip as _Tooltip } from "./ui/tooltip"` in `components/tooltip.tsx`).

### UI elements

- **`ui/`** is generated shadcn/ui — **don't hand-edit** (also ESLint-ignored). Add components with `bunx --bun shadcn@latest add <component>`.
- Prefer the **app-level wrappers** in `components/` over the raw shadcn primitives. In particular, **Tooltips must use `@/components/tooltip`** (`<Tooltip content={...}>…</Tooltip>`) — do **not** import `Tooltip`/`TooltipTrigger`/`TooltipContent` from `ui/tooltip` directly. The only direct use of the primitive is `TooltipProvider`, wired once in `app/layout.tsx`.
- **Confirmations**: gate destructive or irreversible actions (delete a file, remove a provider) behind `ConfirmDialog` from `@/components/confirm-dialog` — don't fire them straight from a click.
- **Menus and commands**: every cross-boundary action is a `Command` (`shared/commands.ts`); its `type` is camelCase. Labels in `COMMAND_META`, native menus (`bun/app/menu.ts`), context menus, dropdown menus, and similar menu-like surfaces are **Title Case** ("Add New Method", "New File", "Close Tab"). Route everything through `executeCommand` rather than calling handlers directly.
- **General UI copy**: ordinary buttons, headings, helper text, empty states, dialogs, and other non-menu labels use sentence case ("Add new method", "Start from example", "No tools yet").

### Performance

**Weigh render performance on every change.** This UI streams events and re-renders hot lists (messages, tool calls), so:

- Wrap components that re-render often or sit in a list in `memo()`. The house pattern is `export const Foo = memo(_Foo)` — the underscore-prefixed inner holds the implementation (see `MessageListItem`, `ThinkingView`, `CodeEditor`).
- Keep memo effective: stabilize props with `useMemo`/`useCallback` and read the store through narrow `useThreadStore(selector)` slices so a component only re-renders on the state it uses.
- Don't reach for `memo()` reflexively on cheap, rarely-rendered components — add it where a profile or the render path shows it pays off.

### Formatting

- **Prettier**: 2-space indent, double quotes, semicolons, es5 trailing commas, tailwind class sorting (`prettier-plugin-tailwindcss`). Import ordering is enforced by `eslint-plugin-import-x`.

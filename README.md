![screenshot](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7fe0a937-a7fa-4a3c-9417-34ee5a35b19d)

[**LLM Space** v4](https://github.com/deer-flow/llm-space) is a desktop app for agent builders — prototype your next agent ideas, inspect every step of your harness execution, debug failures, and evaluate performance, all in one place.

LLM Space is a sister project of [DeerFlow](https://github.com/bytedance/deer-flow), and we dogfood it heavily: every version of DeerFlow is built and debugged with LLM Space. The project started in March 2023, and v4 is its fourth major iteration.

## Features

- **Build** — write and version your prompts, system messages, tools, and model settings.
- **Trace** — see every model call and tool run inside the agent loop as it happens.
- **Debug** — replay a run from history and step through it to find what went wrong.
- **Evaluate** — measure how your agent performs across runs.
- **Manage** — keep your threads organized as files on your own machine.

Your files and API keys stay on your local computer. LLM Space collects a small amount of anonymous usage data to improve the app - see [TELEMETRY.md](./TELEMETRY.md) for exactly what is collected and how to opt out.

## Tech stack

- **Language & tooling** — TypeScript, built and managed with [Bun](https://bun.com).
- **Desktop shell** — [Electrobun](https://electrobun.dev), a lightweight way to ship a native app.
- **UI** — React with Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui.
- **Agent framework** — [Pi Agent Core](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi), a lightweight agent framework for building agents.

## Project layout

LLM Space is a Bun monorepo:

```
packages/
  core/       # Shared logic: types, the agent loop, thread storage
apps/
  desktop/    # The desktop app (Electrobun shell + React UI)
```

## Install

You need [Bun](https://bun.com) first. Bun is a fast, all-in-one runtime and package manager for JavaScript — think of it as a drop-in replacement for Node.js and npm. Follow the [official install guide](https://bun.com/docs/installation).

Once Bun is ready, install the project from the repo root:

```bash
bun install
```

## Run the app

Start the desktop app for local development:

```bash
bun dev
```

Build a canary release:

```bash
bun run build:canary
```

## User guide

The user guide lives in this repository:

- [Documentation index](./docs/index.md)
- [Quick start](./docs/get-started.md)
- [Core concepts](./docs/core-concepts.md)

## Contributing

For now, we only merge pull requests from the [DeerFlow](https://github.com/bytedance/deer-flow) core team members.

Everyone else is very welcome to help by [opening an issue](https://github.com/deer-flow/llm-space/issues) — bug reports, ideas, and feedback all make the project better.

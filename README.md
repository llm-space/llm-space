# LLM Space 4

> A workbench for prompt and agent development — build, trace, debug, evaluate, and manage, all in one place.

**LLM Space** v4 is a desktop tool made for people who build agents. Try out new agent ideas, watch what your agent does step by step, debug it, and measure how well it works — all in one app.

The first version of LLM Space was born in March 2023, and this is its fourth major version.

LLM Space is a side project of our honored open source project [DeerFlow](https://github.com/bytedance/deer-flow). And every version of DeerFlow is built with LLM Space.

## Features

- **Build** — write and version your prompts, system messages, tools, and model settings.
- **Trace** — see every model call and tool run inside the agent loop as it happens.
- **Debug** — replay a run from history and step through it to find what went wrong.
- **Evaluate** — measure how your agent performs across runs.
- **Manage** — keep your threads organized as files on your own machine.

Your files and API keys stay on your local computer.

## Tech stack

- **Language & tooling** — TypeScript, built and managed with [Bun](https://bun.com).
- **Desktop shell** — [Electrobun](https://electrobun.dev), a lightweight way to ship a native app.
- **UI** — React with Tailwind CSS.

## Project layout

LLM Space is a Bun monorepo:

```
packages/
  core/       # Shared logic: types, the agent loop, thread storage
apps/
  desktop/    # The desktop app (Electrobun shell + React UI)
```

## Install

You need [Bun](https://bun.com) first. Bun is a fast, all-in-one runtime and package manager for JavaScript — think of it as a drop-in replacement for Node.js and npm. Follow the [official install guide](https://bun.com/docs/installation).

Once Bun is ready, install the project from the repo root:

```bash
bun install
```

## Run the app

Start the desktop app for local development:

```bash
bun dev
```

Build a canary release:

```bash
bun run build:canary
```
